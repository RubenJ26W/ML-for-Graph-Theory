Instead of generating genuinely correct or helpful outputs, the model discovers “shortcuts” that score highly under the reward setup, which can lead to unnatural or low-quality responses.\n","\n","DPO and GRPO attempt to mitigate this problem without relying on an explicit online reward model.\n","\n","DPO does not train a separate reward network. Instead, it optimizes the policy directly from human preference pairs (chosen vs. rejected responses). By comparing relative preferences instead of absolute reward scores, DPO avoids the risk of the model overfitting to a numerical reward and stays closer to human intent.\n","\n","GRPO uses on-policy sampling with preference-based updates, but still avoids a static learned reward model. It computes advantages from generated responses and human preferences, reducing reliance on a fixed reward function. Since GRPO updates using fresh rollouts, it is less vulnerable to exploiting a frozen reward model.\n","\n","The reference model plays a critical role in stability for both methods. It acts as an anchor that limits how far the new policy can move away from the original pretrained model. Through an implicit or explicit KL constraint, the policy is discouraged from deviating too much, preventing reward hacking and preserving fluency and safety. In short, the reference model maintains alignment by constraining excessive optimization.\n","\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid red\"> </hr>\n","</font></h4>"],"metadata":{"id":"sPsmM7wOgPsQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<b><h4><font color='red'>\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid red\"> </hr>\n","Question 3: </b><br>\n","\n","- In the GSM8K setup, we used a simple binary reward for **format** and **correctness**.  \n","  - What are the limitations of such sparse rewards?  \n","  - How could you design a **richer, smoother** reward signal for math reasoning?\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid red\"> </hr>\n","</font></h4>"],"metadata":{"id":"s6NpkzPMgJh-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<b><h4><font color='green'>\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid red\"> </hr>\n","Answer 3: </b><br>\n","\n","In the GSM8K setup, using a binary reward (1 for correct, 0 for incorrect) has important limitations:\n","\n","It provides very sparse feedback: the model learns nothing when it is almost correct.\n","\n","It treats all mistakes equally, even a small numerical error is punished the same as a completely wrong answer.\n","\n","It does not reward good reasoning steps, only the final answer.\n","\n","To design a richer and smoother reward signal, we could use:\n","\n","- A partial score based on numerical proximity to the correct answer.\n","\n","- Additional reward for showing correct reasoning steps or valid intermediate calculations.\n","\n","- A penalty or bonus based on clarity and conciseness.\n","\n","- A weighted combination of these components would give the model continuous feedback, helping it improve reasoning and not just the final output.\n","\n","I found that some newer methods go beyond DPO and GRPO by providing more stable preference optimization.
